- docker run ubuntu
    pulls the ubuntu image from the docker hub and start a container.

- docker ps  
    Currently running programs

- docker ps -a 
    shows even the stopped containers(in this case ubuntu container would have stopped automatically since we didnt interact with it)

- docker image ls
    Shows all docker images available locally

- docker run -it ubuntu
    Start a container in the interactive mode and load the ubuntu image that we have stored locally
    A shell interface will start with root user with highest priviledges.

- Some basic Linux Commands:
    - echo hello : will display 'hello'
    - whoami : will display the current user ( in this case 'root')
    - echo $0 : location of this shell

- Just like package managers like 'pip', 'npm' etc, in ubuntu we have a package manager called 'apt'
    - apt list : list all packages in this database
    - apt update : update the package database. NOTE: Always run this command before installing a package
    - apt remove 'package name' to remove an installed package, ex: apt remove nano

- dockerignore file:
    dockerignore file is used to exclude files that we copy to our docker image (virtual environment, .env file, etc)
    create the .dockerignore file and add the names of the directories and files you wanna avoid transferring.

- Difference between COPY and ADD
    They are pretty much the same commands, except ADD offers added benefits
    using ADD you can copy files from links as well as add zip files to extract the full content automatically.

- Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT:
    CMD can be over written when running the docker image, while ENTRYPOINT cannot be easily over written.    

- docker history 'name of image'
    command can be used to view the history of layers created while building a docker image.

- docker build -t 'image_name' .
    Used to build the docker image using the dockerfile

- docker run 'image_name'
    Used to run a built image

- docker login
    used to login to your docker account

- docker push 'image name'
    pushes the image to repository in docker-hub

- docker pull 'image name'
    pulls the image from docker-hub

- docker-compose build
    Used to build the images using the docker-compose file

- docker-compose up
    used to run the image built using docker-compose

- docker-compose down
    used to stop and remove everything created by docker-compose up, like stop containers, remove containers, remove default networks

- docker-compose up --build
